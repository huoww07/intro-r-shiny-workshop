### A Tufts University DISC Workshop

## Description

The Shiny package allows you to use R to quickly and easily create and share a web app that includes interactive data visualizations. In this workshop, participants will learn how to make simple R Shiny web apps that display data visualization that users can interact with and explore, and to deploy these web apps so that they are publicly accessible.

## Goals

<ul>
  <li> Use and expand a basic template to quickly make an interactive R Shiny app that lets a user explore data</li>
  <li> Know and use common input and output functions for interactivity </li>
  <li> Understand the concept of reactivity in Shiny, and how to control the propogation of changes from inputs to outputs </li>
  <li> Customize the appearance of a Shiny app</li>
  <li> Share a Shiny app publicly on the internet</li>
</ul>

## Prerequisites:

 Experience with R at the beginning level or above, preferably including experience making plots in R. (The TTS TIDAL workshops “A Gentle Introduction to R” and “Data Visualization in R” would be good preparation.)


## Before the workshop

1. [Download](https://cran.case.edu/) and install R, if you do not already have it: 
2. [Install RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), (the free open source license suffices).
